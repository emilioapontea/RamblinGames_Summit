MainScene: Level_Joy

The character is an orange sphere (so far, it will look better). It can walk and jump vertically by space. Shift can make a dash (twice of maximum speed).

There is a hint when the game starts: Find the three mushrooms then the Star shows up.
If the character steps in lavalake or icelake before having the corresponding mushroom, they will die.
With the correct mushroom, the character can swim in the lake.
When the character steps in the black gap, they will die no matter which status they are at.
With the power mushroom, the character collected all the mushrooms. A star will show up in the scene. You need to find the star.
The star will slide the first two times the character catches it. Only the third time you will get it and win.

You can pause the game with Esc.
After you win, you can see a menu go to the next scene or go bakc to menu or quit.
There's another menu when you are dead, asking you to restart or go to menu or quit.
